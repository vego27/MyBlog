        <p id="P1"> The reason why I like basketball so much is because it is fun it keeps me fit and healthy and also helps me improve clearing my brain and opening it to different learning opurtunities. It is a hard sport to play but when you get it it's interesting and fun. To those people who don't like sports out there basketball is a easy sport to learn but you hhave to be strong and have good stamina to play. When you start playing basketball you won't need any exercise if you train and stretch daily. This is why Basketball is my favorite hobby. </p>
